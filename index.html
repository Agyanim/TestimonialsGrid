            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had 
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free 
            intro course and found it incredibbly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling-time of my life.
            Since sompleting the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some 
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
            I was encourage to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that not tutorial 
            could ever have . in fact, I've often refered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. 
            It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
